This is a test site to experiment with using [govuk-react-jsx](https://github.com/surevine/govuk-react-jsx) with Next.js.

Deployed to <https://try-govuk-react-jsx-next.vercel.app>

## tl;dr

    npm install
    npm run dev

And access page

    http http://localhost:3000

Or production build

    npm run build
    npm start

## debug

Debug server

    npm run debug

Open <chrome://inspect>

Debug test by putting `debugger` in the code where you want to break and run,

    npm --prefix services/govuk-react-jsx-next run test:debug
